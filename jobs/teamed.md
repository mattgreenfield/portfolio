Teamed is a SAAS platform allowing employers to employ people from around the world.

My role as frontend developer was to build and design the interface for employers and employees. I used React and consumed a REST API built with Ruby. The role also involved reporting to management for research and sign-off and managing my own workload and deadlines.

One of the toughest challenges was ensuring both the platform and marketing site were multilingual. We used the React i18n library to achieve this and a Webflow plugin that allowed CMS editing on the marketing site. The interface also needed to make sense for all of our worldwide users, picking an understandable date format for the holiday booking system for example.
