As a frontend developer for Teamed, a SAAS platform that allows employers to hire people from around the world, my role was to build and design the interface for both employers and employees. I utilized React and consumed a REST API built with Ruby in order to complete this task.

In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also reported to management for research and sign-off and managed my own workload and deadlines. One of the biggest challenges I faced in this role was ensuring that both the platform and the marketing site were fully multilingual. To achieve this, we used the React i18n library and a Webflow plugin that allowed for CMS editing on the marketing site.

Another important aspect of my role was to create an interface that made sense for all of our worldwide users. This included selecting an understandable date format for the holiday booking system, among other considerations. Overall, my role as a frontend developer for Teamed required me to use my technical skills and problem-solving abilities in order to create a user-friendly and effective platform.
