At Upzelo, I built and maintained all three main areas of the frontend: the admin area, the installable product, and the marketing website.

Working in a scrum team of 2 backend devs, a designer, and myself.

The three products shared a design system that I built and kept in sync with it's Figma counterpart. The business requirements lead to several rebuilds and the design system allowed this to be relatively seamless.

The team used Github to manage releases and run tests. A large part of the job was also reviewing other frontend changes made by other developers.
