One of my main responsibilities was updating the legacy codebase to incorporate modern technologies and take advantage of new capabilities that were not previously available.

One of the major projects I worked on was building a drag and drop site builder with inline editing capabilities. This site builder could be previewed on three different sample screen widths, and I was responsible for building some of the first responsive website templates. I also played a key role in moving away from using gifs for border radius and other outdated techniques. When I first started at Create, we still supported IE6, but we were able to quickly phase out this outdated browser.

Overall, my role at Create was very collaborative and allowed me to learn a lot about UX and project management, as well as the fundamentals and best practices of frontend development.
