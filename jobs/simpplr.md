I was responsible for building a user-customizable dashboard using React, Redux, and CSS modules. To document and develop my work, I utilized Storybook. Throughout the project, I worked closely with the design team to develop ideas and suggest improvements.

Later, we moved on to a greenfield project where we implemented GraphQL and shared components across React and React Native.

The work was managed using Agile methodologies, and I took a scrum master training course to learn more about this approach.
