StratumFive provides software for managing large ships (the type that carries shipping containers). We built multiple products to be used both onshore and at sea (for this we built a PWA that could be used offline).

The frontend was built with VueJS and typescript and we integrated our Cypress tests with the deployment pipeline. It was essential that we had no downtime as the software was relied on for safety.

We built a lot of different chart types into a customisable dashboard, as well as building our own map layers for weather and port overlays. I implemented Storybook to ensure our shared component library could be tested and developed with a large sample of test data.

My role involved leading 2 more junior frontend developers.
