## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    The Gatsby CLI helps you create new sites using Gatsby starters (like this one!)

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```
