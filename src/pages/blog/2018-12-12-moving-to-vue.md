Long time React developer making the move to Vue.js.
They are similar in the concepts, not in the syntax.

## Some concepts are the same;

- props and proptypes

## Some are different

- HTML is kept seperate from the data manipulation (unless you use jsx).
- slots, not children. Named slots rather than passing components as props
- emit events rather than passing down functions as props
  -- how do I do function as child?
