Not long ago I attended Magento Live in London. [Paul Kinlan](https://twitter.com/paul_kinlan) took to the stage to explain progressive web apps and how they could benefit ecommerce sites.

- Auto login, across devices, massive reduction in failed logins
- Save to home screen, ask after they've checked out or at any chosen point in the journey
- Auto fill credit card details is getting better. A w3c standard similar to Apple pay.
- Notifications, "sale now on".
- Compete with installed apps on a users home screen. Your shop will sit right next to the Amazon and ebay apps.

My colleague [Hob](https://hobadams.com/) and I were lucky enough to be invited to the Google training center for a 2 day workshop on progressive web apps.
