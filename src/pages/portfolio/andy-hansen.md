I helped Andy out with turning his illustrations in to this [parralaxing home page](http://andyhansen.co.uk/index.html).
I also implemented a lightbox javascript library, allowing users to click on an image to enlarge it and launch the gallery view.

<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__item one-half">
        <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/andy-hansen.jpg" alt="The home page from Andys site" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid__item one-half">
        <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/andy-hansen-lightbox.jpg" alt="Andys site with an expanded view of one of his illustrations" />
    </div>
</div>

I decided to try a CSS-only paralaxing and it was really interesting to see it in action.
The technique was found [here](http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/) and uses 3d transforms to scale the images based on scroll position.
It's not great in terms of browser support and maybe I would have used a JS library if I was to do it again, however it was great to see how far CSS alone can get you.

The end result is a site that is both a means of showing Andys work in detail and a great example of his work in itself.
