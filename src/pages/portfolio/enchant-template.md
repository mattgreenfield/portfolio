The challenge of building a website template to be used with a content management system (CMS) is one I face regularly in my day to day work.

I was tasked with building an elegant and modern template theme for the Create CMS. That works with a variety of user content, page title lengths, shop options etc.

The site was to be aimed at the wedding and/or jewellery industries. And some basic designs were formed for me to work from. Here's what I made;

<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__item one-half">
        <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/enchant-home.jpg" alt="website screenshot" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid__item one-half">
        <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/enchant-shop.jpg" alt="website screenshot" />
    </div>
</div>

and here it is themed differently;

<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__item one-half">
        <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/enchant-alliance.jpg" alt="website screenshot, themed different" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid__item one-half">
        <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/enchant-alliance-mobile.jpg" alt="website screenshot, themed differently and shown on a small screen width" />
    </div>
</div>
