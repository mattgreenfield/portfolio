Welcome to the blog section of my site, I guess this post is just to test that its all working OK but let me outline what it may contain...

- The tools and plugins that I have used and like.
- The things that I have learnt that really make a difference to how I work.
- The process of finding my way in the web design world - from bedroom designer to world domination.... maybe.
