In order to improve how we do agile we went on some Scrum master training. The aim was not to become a team full of scrum masters.

- Stories should be focused on the user and what benefit it will give them. They define outcomes, not outputs.
- I learnt stories are not tasks. This should help with our burndown as it will be used to track tasks that are easy to define as 'done'
- Scrum teams should be small and cross discpline.
- It's not 'done' untill it's ready to ship. Tested, text written, deployed.
